I converted a set of woodworking plans for a [Construction-grade Backhoe Loader](http://www.woodstore.net/cobalo.html) from WOOD Magazine into a set of 3D-printable models. Files for the parts I printed are available here, along with some instructions on printing them. 

I printed in ABS and did some post-print gluing and welding with an acetone/ABS slurry.  I did not print the wheels, pegs,  smokestack, or any hardware, all of which are available in the [project kit](http://www.woodstore.net/cobalo.html).


These files are published with permission from [WOOD Magazine](http://www.woodmagazine.com/). All original plans for the [Construction-grade Backhoe Loader](http://www.woodstore.net/cobalo.html) are copyright &copy; 2014 Meredith Corporation. If you like the project, consider buying the plans and/or the project kit.
